# Fitness-Application---MySQL
Fitness Application in which users can log meals and exercises. For the exercise, users can log depending on the type, intensity and time which the system calculates the total calories burned. For the meals, users can add ingredients which then the system calculates the total calories using the database created by the CFG (Canada's Food Guide).

I developed an application designed to help users maintain a comprehensive journal of their diet and exercise routines. All the information that the user has inputed gets stored in a MySQL database in which I use to access the information. The database also includes all the food items from the CFG (Canadian Nutrient guide) which is used to calculate the calories of ingredients as well as other calculations. The primary function of the app is to allow users to log their daily food intake by specifying the food items and ingredients they consume. Using the data from the Canadian Nutrient File (CNF), the app calculates the nutrient and calorie intake, as well as categorizes the food items into respective food groups. 

The app aligns its dietary recommendations with the guidelines of the Canada Food Guide, providing users with insights into how well their diet matches these guidelines. Users can easily track their consumption of various food groups and understand their nutritional balance.

On the exercise front, the app assists users in monitoring their physical activities. By calculating the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) based on the user's personal data, the app can estimate the calories burned across different levels of exercise intensity. This feature helps users understand the impact of their exercise routines on their overall calorie balance.

Additionally, the app offers visualizations of the logged data over different time periods. Users can view trends and patterns in their diet and exercise habits, which aids in making informed decisions about their health and fitness goals. This functionality helps users see the direct correlation between their dietary intake, exercise routines, and potential weight changes. The information is displeyed in pie graphs which display the protein, saturated fats, ect that they have gained throughout the timeline specified.
